## ‚úîÔ∏è Overview

<p>
  The AIS-System (Automated File Download and Conversion Application) is a project designed to streamline the daily task of downloading a specific file from the JMC website and converting it to a modified format. The application automates the login process, filters the desired time range, searches for the file, downloads it, and converts it from HTML to XLSX format.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Features:

<ul>
  <li><b>Automated Login:</b> The application automatically logs in to the JMC website, eliminating the need for manual login by the employee.</li>
  <li><b>Date Filtering:</b> The application filters the files based on a specified time range of 7 days, ensuring that only the relevant files are downloaded.</li>
  <li><b>File Search:</b> The application searches for the desired file within the filtered results, saving time and effort for the employee.</li>
  <li><b>Download and Storage:</b> Before initiating the download, the application checks if the company's system has a folder named "Temp." If the folder doesn't exist, it creates it. Additionally, the application creates a folder named "AIS" within the "Temp" folder. The downloaded file is then saved in the "AIS" folder for further processing.</li>
  <li><b>File Conversion:</b> After the download, the application converts the downloaded file from HTML format to XLSX format. This conversion enables easier modification and processing of the file.</li>
</ul>
